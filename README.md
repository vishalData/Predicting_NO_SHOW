# Predictive_Booking_Optimizer
## Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling Report:

1. Introduction:
This report provides an overview of the data analysis and predictive modeling
performed on the dataset provided. The dataset contains information about bookings,
including various features such as booking slot, average order value, and the
occurrence of no-shows etc.

2. Data Preprocessing & EDA:
The dataset is loaded from the provided CSV file and explored using pandas functions.
Data current shape= [ 181859 rows × 73 columns ]
Initial data exploration included displaying the first few rows, obtaining information about
the dataset, and checking for missing values.
Basic statistics of the dataset are calculated to gain insights into the numerical features.
Missing values are handled by filling them with the mean of their respective columns.
The distribution of the 'ns' column (indicating no-shows) and the 'bookingslot' feature
are analyzed to understand their frequency distribution. And we got to know that out of
25 features, only one that is ‘booking slot’ types are object .

3. Data Visualization:
Visualization techniques, including count plots and heatmaps, are utilized to visualize
the distribution of the target variable (no-shows) and explore relationships between
features.
Boxplots are created to identify potential outliers in numerical features.Outlier is an
observation in a given dataset that lies far from the rest of the observations and the
data had some outlier.

4. Feature Engineering:Categorical variables like ‘booking slot’ are encoded using one-hot encoding to prepare
the data for modeling. So now we have a dataset as [181859 rows × 75 columns].
Float values are rounded to two decimal places to ensure consistency and reduce
complexity.
Infinite values are replaced with a large number to prevent errors during modeling.
Finally we have converted float values to simple integers to reduce the computation and
reduce overfitting. Performance considerations: Converting features to integers may
improve the performance or efficiency of the RandomForestClassifier algorithm. Integer
computations are generally faster than floating-point computations.

5. Predictive Modeling:
The data is split into 80:20 ratio where 80% for training and 20% for testing.
I have used RandomForestClassifier from scikit-learn as the predictive model for binary
classification of no-shows.
The RandomForestClassifier model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the
testing set.
Why RFC ?
● Ensemble Learning: It is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple
decision trees and combines their predictions. This often results in improved
performance compared to individual decision trees, especially when dealing with
complex datasets or high-dimensional feature spaces as in our case.
● Robustness to Overfitting: Random Forest tends to be less prone to overfitting
compared to some other algorithms, such as decision trees. This is because it
builds multiple trees and averages their predictions, reducing the variance of the
model.
Model performance is assessed using accuracy and confusion matrix taking use of
scikit learn.
We have also calculated the classification report for our model and also plotted the
heatmap for confusion matrix.

6. Results and Insights:
The RandomForestClassifier achieved a certain level of accuracy in predicting
no-shows based on the provided features.
Feature importances are analyzed to identify the most influential features in predicting
no-shows. I have also plotted the top five most important features present in the
dataset.
The optimal threshold for prediction is determined based on expected benefits,
considering the consequences of false positives and false negatives.
Determining the ideal threshold for prediction is crucial for optimizing the performance of
predictive models, especially when there are costs and benefits associated with
different prediction outcomes.
By considering the problem's objectives and constraints, we can select the threshold
that maximizes the overall benefit or minimizes the overall cost, thereby improving
the effectiveness of the predictive model in practical applications.
7. Conclusion:
The predictive modeling approach demonstrated the potential to predict no-shows in
booking data effectively.
Feature importances provided insights into the significant factors influencing no-show
occurrences.The determined optimal threshold can guide decision-making in mitigating the impact of
no-shows on business operations.
