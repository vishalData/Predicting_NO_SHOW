A major pain-point for customers is non-arrival of professionals for their service without prior
intimation, (called No-Show) and leads to a bad experience. In case Accelerated prediction of
No-Show enables the platform (organization) to deploy additional strategies to re-assign the
booking to another professional.
We need to build a predictive model to predict No-Show probability of a request.


Task list : 
- Performing a comprehensive EDA
- Sharing additional relevant insights and visualizations,
- Build a predictive model to predict no-Show given the features described
- Find the ideal threshold for prediction if , the benefit of a correct no-show prediction is 400, benefit of  correctly predicting a no-show NOT happening is 0, cost of incorrectly predicting a booking as no-show is -200, cost of incorrectly predicting a booking as NOT no-show is -150 .
